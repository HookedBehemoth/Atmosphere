Corrected a problem which generated improper hash values on 16 bit machines
Routine SHA1Update changed from
	void SHA1Update(SHA1_CTX* context, unsigned char* data, unsigned int
len)
to
	void SHA1Update(SHA1_CTX* context, unsigned char* data, unsigned
long len)

The 'len' parameter was declared an int which works fine on 32 bit machines.
However, on 16 bit machines an int is too small for the shifts being done
against
it.  This caused the hash function to generate incorrect values if len was
greater than 8191 (8K - 1) due to the 'len << 3' on line 3 of SHA1Update().

Since the file IO in main() reads 16K at a time, any file 8K or larger would
be guaranteed to generate the wrong hash (e.g. Test Vector #3, a million
"a"s).

I also changed the declaration of variables i & j in SHA1Update to 
unsigned long from unsigned int for the same reason.

These changes should make no difference to any 32 bit implementations since
an
int and a long are the same size in those environments.

--
I also corrected a few compiler warnings generated by Borland C.
1. Added #include <process.h> for exit() prototype
2. Removed unused variable 'j' in SHA1Final
3. Changed exit(0) to return(0) at end of main.

ALL changes I made can be located by searching for comments containing 'JHB'

1- Removed #include <process.h> and used return() instead of exit()
2- Fixed overwriting of finalcount in SHA1Final() (discovered by Chris Hall)
3- Changed email address from steve@edmweb.com to sreid@sea-to-sky.net
